Thank you for your interest in CattlePi

All contributions are welcome.  
Since this is a pretty young project there aren't a lot of rules to follow for now. 

The few rules we have: 
 * https://github.com/cattlepi/cattlepi/blob/master/LICENSE#L130
 * we don't break backwards compatibility - think about the existing users 
 * when contributing you should test/validate your contribution before submitting it
 * we want to have fun an build something useful 
 
The standard Fork/Change/PR workflow applies for contributing code.
